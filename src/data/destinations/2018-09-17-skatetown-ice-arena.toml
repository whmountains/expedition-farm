description = "Whether you are a newbie lacing on skates for the very first time or are a figure skater trying to land your axel, SkateTown is the place to go. With its two large indoor ice rinks and a special holiday rink available during the Christmas season, there is a spot on the ice for everyone. The staff are always friendly, and will use their expertise to ensure that your skates fit properly and are tied to perfection (because blisters are so not ‚Äúcool‚Äù).\n\nTake Note:\n\n* Check public session times before scheduling your expedition. Although hours are typically reliable, it is not fun to show up while a figure skating competition, hockey game, or curling match is occupying the public rink. (Trust me, this has happened before üòõ )\n* Contrary to popular belief, it is best to wear the thinnest socks possible. I wear tights in my skates, and find that they reduce blisters due to a more accurate and snug fit.\n* We suggest you check out the dining options available on Sierra College exit if you want to grab a quick bite to eat on your way to or from the rink. There‚Äôs even FROYO!\n"
